    "How come? This outcome makes people suspect that the residents of those areas are racist. However, since it is a phenomenon which is observed even in more progressive and multicultural areas (i.e. London), there may be some other mechanism at work too. Thomas Schelling, who won the Nobel Prize in Economics in 2005, explained that there is a strong force behined this phenomenon, which is homophily: people tend to hang out with other people with similar characteristics. Schelling modelled this mechanism in a very simple setup, and then showed that, even abstracting from explanations relying on intolerance and racism, we would still get a pretty segregated urban landscape. \n",
    "\n",
    "This intuition generated lots of research, and current studies about racial segregation are substantially based on a Schelling model on steroids. With this project, we will build a version of this model, and we will perform some simulations to establish the consequences of playing with parameters' values. \n",
